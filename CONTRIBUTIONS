1. Code is organized into more classes.
2. New nucleotide types are added for multiscale modeling.
3. Rigid and soft regions in DNA origami design are clustered using depth-first-search graph traversal algorithm.
4. Different spring constants are added for long- and short-range soft connections.
5. Skips in cadnano design files are handled properly.
